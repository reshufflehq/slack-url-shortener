This is a [Reshuffle](https://reshuffle.com/) template.

## A starting point for creating your API with Reshuffle.

This is a Reshuffle template app. Reshuffle provides a progressive way to build fullstack applications, without needing to understand the cloud.

> Note: Reshuffle is built on top of Create React App and Express for the backend

## Getting Started

1. `npm start` to run a local version of your app.
2. Make changes, and see them reflected locally.
  > Note: Your frontend code resides in the standard `src` directory.
          Backend code needs to reside in the `backend` directory. [Read more here](http://dev.reshuffle.com)
3. `npx reshuffle deploy` to deploy your app to the cloud.

## Available Scripts

In the directory of your Reshuffle project, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
You will see any backend errors on the command line


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npx reshuffle deploy`

Deploys your Reshuffle app to the cloud, thereby making it available on your apps URL.

> Note: `reshuffle deploy` implicitly runs `npm run build`
